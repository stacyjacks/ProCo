#ProCo

**ProCo** is a tiny and very straightforward **Android** app that helps you to control your daily protein intake. 

It allows the user to set up a daily goal based on their needs, automatically tracking its fulfilment by performing simple addition operations of the user's input (in grams) throughout the day.
Moreover, it also allows the user to set up presets of foods and meals they consume regularly, which can then be added to the current progress, making this chore as easy and painless as possible. 

It is fully written in **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, following the **MVVM** design pattern and clean architecture. 
Data is stored exclusively on the device, using Android's **Room** persistence library.
